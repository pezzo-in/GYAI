            They say life is a game – if so, then we got to train every day. At #RevolutionGYAI, everyday has a new
            lesson to teach. We believe, that when life doesn’t follow a set syllabus, why must we ? The answer to
            this question gave birth to our revolutionary training system called – OSETS (Open Source
            Entrepreneurial Training System). Here, our complete focus is the all-round development of an
            individual. Mentally, Emotionally, Financially and Spiritually. Our focus at GYAI has always been on the
            3 most important domains that define success -
        </p>


        <h3>Life Skills</h3>

        <div class="divider_page"></div>
        <p> To most this is an alien term. But for those who have achieved any form of significant
            success, they know this is the most important domain one must master even before expecting any small
            degree of success. This domain is about shaping the mind. Life skills are as important to a person as an
            Operating system to a PC. But it’s equally important to have a Bug Free OS. AT GYAI, we help each
            individual, discover the Who, What, When, Where, Why and How’s of their life plan.
        </p>


        <h3>Business Skills</h3>

        <div class="divider_page"></div>
        <p>At GYAI we nourish the natural business skills that we all are born with and help our
            aspiring entrepreneurs realize that they were always meant to be their own boss. We have always been
            great salesmen - every time you have faced a job interview, proposed a girl/guy, negotiate with our
            parents on why you must get more pocket money/or with your employer why you must get a better ctc. We
            are all born businessmen. We just weren’t told that while growing up. In OSETS, we’ll give you enough
            proof that you always were capable of achieving massive success.
        </p>

        <h3>Financial Skills</h3>

        <div class="divider_page"></div>
        <p>
            Here is the most important skill that is not taught to us in our entire 20+ yrs. of
            education. Financial skills is not about WE working to make more money. It’s about getting the money we
            earn to work for us. We go through 20+yrs of education only to get into a good job to make a good salary
            (money). But do you really know who creates this money and how just 2% of the world is earning more than
            60% of the world’s wealth ? Interestingly, most of these 2% do not have 20+yrs of traditional education.
            What they have that they built their fortunes on, is Financial Skills.

            Today, there is an increasing demand for entrepreneurs in order to bridge the growing gap
            between job seekers and job creators in India. To meet this demand, practical entrepreneurial training
            has become a necessity at the graduate level. It is important that we deliver to our youth practical
            business knowledge, business skills and financial skills while they are still in college. In an effort
            to provide the same, #RevolutionGYAI has a specially designed program that we wish to bring to colleges
            to not just create awareness but also create real time entrepreneurs at a graduate level.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though quite a few traditional minded people feel that it's too early for a 19yr old to learn
            entrepreneurship, we disagree. The time between 18 to 35yrs of age is the most critical time of anyone’s
            life. How you invest this time, will decide if you will work for profits or wages for the rest of your
            life. It is a myth that one must work at a job to be a successful entrepreneur. Through our associations
            with the college Ecells, we wish to bring to the students practical entrepreneurial training that will
            help them build their mind before they are capable to build a business. This will not just give them
            massive confidence to start up an enterprise but also minimise their chances of failure.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Here are the few objectives that we wish to achieve via #RevolutionGYAI Ecells</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Imparting high standards in coaching and mentoring, in the field of Socio-Entrepreneurship.
            </li>
            <li>
                Helping students uncover their potential and overcome key mental blocks like fear of failure,
                rejection, public speaking, success etc.

            </li>
            <li>
                Provide them with a platform to help them build themselves into better citizens and business
                leaders.
            </li>
            <li>
                Coach them on the latest socio-entrepreneurial trends and helping them create a good social capital
                that can be leveraged for their ventures as customers or for crowd funding.
            </li>
            <li>
                Creating Socio-Entrepreneurs who not only focus on their profits but also give equal importance on
                creating a positive social impact with the ventures they start.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
